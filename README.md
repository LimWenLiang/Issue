## Method of Issues Submission:

1. Do not delete anything (including the structure and the example) from this repo. You just add the solution/answer of the given issue.
2. Create a package using `issue<IssueNumber>` format inside "/src/main/java". For example, `/src/main/java/issue03`and add your Java source codes inside the package.  
3. Add the screenshot of the output into the `images` folder and update the output at new `README.md` inside `issue<IssueNumber>` package.
4. See `issue01` and `issue02` as the examples
